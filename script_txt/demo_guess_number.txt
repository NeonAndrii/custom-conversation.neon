Script: "Demo Guess Number"
Author: Daniel McKnight
Description:
    Neon will select a number between 1 and 10 at random
    and give hints until the user guesses correctly.

Variable: {numbers}: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Variable: {neon_num}: random(numbers)
Variable: {user_guess}: ""

Speak:
#    "My number is {neon_num}"
    "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10"
    "Guess what it is or say 'exit'"
LOOP guess
voice_input{user_guess}
if {user_guess} in {numbers}:
    if {user_guess} == {neon_num}:
        Neon speak: "You guessed it!"
        Exit
    if {user_guess} > {neon_num}:
        Neon speak: "Lower"
        LOOP guess END
    if {user_guess} < {neon_num}:
        Neon speak: "Higher"
        LOOP guess END
else
    if {user_guess} != "exit":
        Neon speak:
        "That's not a valid guess, try again."
        LOOP guess END
Exit
